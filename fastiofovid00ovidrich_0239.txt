Rex Sacrorum. ln ancient days the king was also priest:
Melchizedek, king of Salem, was also ‘priest of the most high
G0d‚’ and the patriarchs offered up sacrifice for their familics.
Afterwards when the offices of king and priest were separated,
the title ‘ king ' was still retained by the priestly officers, as by
the Rex Sacrorum at Rome, and by the ἅρχων βασιλεὺς or
Minister of Religion, at Athens. The Rex Sacrorum was the
head of the priests (sacerdotes), but all the priests were sub-
ordinate to the College or Guild of petzlz'ſsces.
