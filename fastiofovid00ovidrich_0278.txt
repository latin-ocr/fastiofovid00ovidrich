238 NOTES. BOOK HJ. [ll. [ιδ-ιη ¹

118. res sc. the fact that 10 is a distinguished number.

119. inde ‘for this reason.' patres ‘senators' decem
in orbes. In the beginning of Romulus' reign, before the
Sabines of Tatius were united to the Romans (see Smith's small
Rom. Hz'st. p. 11) the Senate consisted of 100, who were
divided into ten decuriae (decuria = a group of ten), each
decuria representing one of the ten patrician curiae. From
each decuria one representative was chosen to form a body
called the ‘ decem primi‚' foremost of whom was the ‘princeps
senatus.' orbes seems to mean either ‘groups’ zze. decuriae,
or possibly refers to a certain rotation observed in choosing the
‘ decem primi.'

120. hastatos decem apparently ‘ten divisions (sc. orbes)
of Hastati.' A legion contained thirty maniples, ten of Hastati, ¹
len of Principes, ten of Triarii (or Pilani) ε this was the arrange-
ment during the second Punic War.

The Hastati formed the first line [kasta‚ a ‘pike ’].

The Prz‘ncz'sbes the second line (they were once the first line,
therefore called principes). Ἴ
The Triarii or pilam· [pilum a strong ‘ javelin,' a missile] ι
the veterans, the third line. ἶ

121. princeps, pilanus sing. for pl. corpora. ε orbes ξ
(119), partes (123).

122. legitimo ‘ allowed by laW,’ τ’. e. furnished at the
expense of the state. In 403 B.o. a new class of equites arose,
who provided their own horse. The equites as a military force
formed ten turmae (‘ squadrons ’).

merebat sc. stipendium, ‘ served.' The body of cavalry
attached to each legion was divided into ten turmae.

123. Each of the three old patrician tribes was divided
into ten curiae. Titienses the Sabine element introduced by
Titus Tatius: Ramnenses the Romans or Latins of Romulus:
Luceres [connected with Lucumo ‘chief man '] the Etruscan
part of the population.

126. hoc spatio. We should here have expected the
accus. of duration, For instances of the abl. in such cases see
Appendix γ. Perhaps we may say that spatium, which is
itself sifgnificant of duration, is, in construction, treated as a
point o time.

127. neu = et ne ‘and that you may not doubt.‚.'
