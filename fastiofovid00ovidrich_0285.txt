a. 334-37 5] MARCH. 245

354. pollicitam. Notice the deponent participle in a
pass sense. fidem ‘faithful fulfilment.’

357. tonuit sine nube. Of. Horace Od. I.‚ xxxiv. 7
“ Diespiter...per purum tonantes Egit equos,’' a prodigy always
reckoned noteworthy by the Romans. The so-called shield was
doubtless a meteoric stone, which might fall in a clear sky with
an accompanying report, as of thunder.

359. A media regione, like a. tergo, a fronte, ἐξ ἀριστερᾶς,
and the like, indicates the quarter whence the object strikes the
senses : the expression means ‘ directly opposite)

360. summisere ‘raised' summitto = (1) to send up
from below, raise, (2) to cast down.

361. scutum prop. is the oblong shield, generally of
wood, and cased with leather [σκῦτος]. The clipeus and parma
were round, and of metal. This was no ordinary aerolite‚ such
as would bury itself deeply in the ground.

365. ancile [perh. from ἅγκυλος ‘curved': cf. ange.
Ovid derives the word from amb-caedo, cf. 789]. The shape
of the ancile was like the figure 8, an oval with its two sides
clipped. See the picture in Smith's small Rom. Hz'st. p. 13.
Paley remarks that the old shape is still preserved in modern
escutcheons, even to the twisted hornlike projectione on the
upper part.

366. quemque ‘and no angle is present, for you to
observo? quem = talem ut notes. Another reading is Quaque
notes.

367. Cf. l. 334.

370. error ‘that confusion may play before the eyes of
any one plotting against its safety.'

371. Mamurius cf. 1. 248. Supply utrum before morum .·
‘ of whom it is ffiffioult to say whether he was more perfect in
character or 111 skill.’ Exactus here followed by a gem'tive,
like peritus. Cf. scitus V. 54, and Lat. Prz‘merg 132. Notice
illud separated by dicere from the rest of its clause. Another
reading is ulli. But dffcile est ulli dicere is doubtful Latin,
since ullus and quisquam can only be used after a negative, or
quam, or si, or some such restrictive word.

375. arma ‘ their martial equipment.' verba ‘a liturgy ’
(= carmen, 378), the Carmen Saliare. A fragment of these
ancient hymns is preserved by Varro.
