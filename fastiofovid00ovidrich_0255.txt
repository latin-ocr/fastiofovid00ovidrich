ll. 42-61] FEBRUARY. 215

42. Phasida, Medea ‘of Phasis.' When deserted by

³ Jason, she ssed to Athens and married Aegeus. She was

an enchantress. credulus ‘too readily believing her story.’
43. Amphiaraides. Alcmaeon murdered his mother Eri·

, phyle, who had been bribed to induce her husband Amphiaraus

to join in the war of the “ Seven against Thebes,'' which Am-
phiaraus knew would be fatal to him. Cf. Virgil, Aen. VI.
445 “moestamque Eriphylen, Vulnera monstrantem nati.’'
Alcmaeon was purified in the stream of the Achelous, which
flows into the sca about thirty miles from Naupactus.

47—54. The ‘year of Romulus ' consisted of ten months:
Numa added two more, J anuary and February, to these. lt is
admitted that he made February, ending as it does with the
festival of Terminus, the last. mouth in the year. The position
held by January is not so clear. Some suppose January to
have been the eleventh and February the twelfth month, the
year beginning with March. Ovid, on the other hand, says
that Numa’s year began—Jmmary, March, April. . . , and
ended with . . . December, February : and here states, what we
do not find elsewhere stated, that the Decemviri (B.C. 451), pre-
sumably in a supplement to the XII. Tables, first altered this
arrangement, making the year to begin as now—Jan., F eb.,
March, and to close with December.

50. finis sacrorum the Terminalia.

57. nunc ubisiut. Merkel, followinga majority of MSS„
rea-ls Nunc ubi sint illis quae sunt saerata· Kalendis, Templa
deae ’ἐ which Muraley adopts without comment. Not knowing
any parallel instance of such a dependent interrogation with
nothing to depend on, Ι have taken one of the alternative MS.
readings. Another alternative is to read sunt for sint.

60. ducis Augustus, of whom it was said “urbem mar·
moream reliquit, quam latericiam acceperat.”
