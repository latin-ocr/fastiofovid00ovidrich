ll. 242-257] JANUARY. ἡ 195

'I'o a inan standing on this plot with his sace turned in the same
direction as that in which the river flows, the Tiber would be on
the left, the right bank of the river being the same as the l‘fl
side of the plot. euius of course depends on latus.

242. Macaulay's “ yellow Tiber.’'

243. silva. As an illustration of this cf. Collis Viminalz&
[fr. vimen ‘osier‚'] and Esquilinus [fr. aesculus ‘Italian oak.']

246. Ianiculum [Janus—col0J.

247. patiens deorum ‘trodden by gods.’ For the con·
struction cf. Horace, Od. Ι. v'iii. 4, “patiens pulveris atque
solis,’' cf. Lat. Pr. ξ 132.

249. Cf. Met. 1. 150, “Ultima caelestum terras Astraea
reliquit.’' ln the golden age Astraea, the goddess of Justice,

lived with other im mortals 011 the earth, which she was the last
to eave.

251. pudor = αἰδώς, ‘ a sense of shame,' ‘ shamefacedness)

252. reddere jura here used very much like jus dare (see
1 207), but not in so strictly technical a sense. Raida (see
Note on 1. 112) = (1) ‘to give back‚’ (2) ‘to render what is
due.' Thus the postman reddit, z'.e. duly delivers‚ a letter
which has been entrusted to him. So the judge reddit jura
‘ renders j ustice,’ discharging the commission given him.

253. nil sc, erat, pacem postesque tuebar (a zeugma).

257. Every ‘archway' was called a Jiznus. A part of the
Forum, containing three such archways, danus Summus, Medius
and Imus, was the Lonibard Street or Exchange of Rome. Eut
Ovid here speaks of tne small chapel (l. 275) of Jauus, which
was open in time of war and shut in time of peace. lt adjoined
the porta Janualrs 1.) 265), somewhere between the Palatine and
Quirinal. By dzcomcssorz's some think tlie F. Romanuin and F.
J ulium are meant, Merkel and others the F, R. and F. Piscator-ium.
Ovid wrote these lines in the reign of Augustus, and takes no
notice of Numa's temple ‘ at the bottom of the Argiletum ' (Livy
Ι. 19), or osa temple built by Duillius ⁴ in the Forum Holitoriumss
which was afterwards restored by Tiberius, and is alluded to in
lines 223—6, added at the revision of the poem. All the temples
except the small chapel would seem to have fallen into decay,
since Ovid here says ‘sacratus in uno.’ [In ll. 163 there is an
allusion to a temple of J anus just outside the Porta Carmentalis,
which Merkel identifies with Numa's temple t the ordinary
theories of topography seem to identify it with Duillius’s.]
