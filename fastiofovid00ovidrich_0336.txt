In a conditional sentence the rule is tha& conj. in the
apodosis balances conj. in the protasis, and indic. balances
indic.. But verbs expressive of possibility, duty, a wish,
necessity, fitness (including the periphrastic use of esse with the
gerundive, and esse with fut. participle) are regularly used in
. the past indic. instead of the conj„ to express that such and
such a thing was possible, due, wished for, necessayy, fit, evoe,
and they retain the indic. even in the apodosis of a conditional
sentence, v hen the protasis is in the conj.

Observc that there is no real inconsistency. The writer in
such a case speaks of the actual possibilizys, fitness, &a of
doing certain acts, and not of the acts themselves. This idiom
is found in prose as well as in verse.
