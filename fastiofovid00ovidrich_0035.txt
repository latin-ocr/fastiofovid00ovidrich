The connexion between kindred words will often
be more easily observed if they are pponounced as a
Roman pronounced them: A = ab, E = a in gate,
Ε = e in get, I = e, U like oo, but a lighter sound.
V probably = w. O always hard like k, and G like
g in go. J or consonantal Ι like y in you. T always
hard (6.9. in natio as in natus).

It will easily be understood how, in very early
days, when there was no writing or literature to fix
the forms of words, changes were always going on—
some from a tendenoy to make words easier to pro-
nounce, others from the contrary effort to keep words
distinct.

Thus letters dropped off at the beginning [I. 107,
[II. 564]‚ in the middle [I. 260, II. 459]‚ and at the
end of words [ey. -ere for -erunt of perf]

Euphonic vowels [II. 117] and consonants [VL
516] crept in.

The word Assimilation is a standing instance of the
process it describes [ad-similo becoming assimilo]

Dissimilation gives us popularis and australis [V.
434] and claustrum for claudtrum, dxc.

[VLiiqgiktiji letters like L and P. are often interchanged
