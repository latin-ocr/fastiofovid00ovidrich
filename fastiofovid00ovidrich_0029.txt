‘5 3] JNTROD [JCTJONS. xix

Ovid is indebted to the various annalists, or chron-
iclers, a short account of whom is given below. ¹4

M. Fulvius Nobilior, Consul B.c. 189, was one of the earliest
annalists‚ and set up a Tabula Fastorum in the Temple Hercules

Musarum (Cf. Vl. 705).
sunius Gracchanus, contemporary with Fulvius.
The poet Ennius wrote his Annales, a work known to Ovid.

[The elder Scipio Africanus, and Scipio Nasica also wrote
historical works.]
Fabius Pictor.

Μ. Porcius Cato, b. 243, d. 149 B.c. wrote Orzgrz'nes: the
iiffnssltein’apt to write regular history in Latin, as distinct from

L. Calpurnius Piso, Consul 133 Β. 0.
Valerius Antias wrote at least seventy-five books of Historiae.
L. Cincius came a little before Varro.

M. Terentius Varro, b. 116, d. 26 B.c. A genuine Roman
of the old type but with a tincture of the new Greek culture:
omnivorous and omniscient, with popular sympathies and a
rough humour which delighted in the grotesque: a strong
politician as well as a man of letters: he wrote 620 books,
{23³{Zififfiegevaefityt'i‘ssurex‘ffiffessssawffiis ἒὲωξέ ἶὲἕέἴὲ-ἷὲ)
rerum divin. et humanarum. Par? of his grammatical {remigev
de lingua Latina also survives.

M. Verrius Flaccus, contemporary of Augustus, and, Merkel
thinks, of Tiberius3 a libertinus who wrote Fasti and a ‹lic-
tionary of antiquities: quotes and epitomises Varro (Merkel

XCV. ).

Festus (2nd century A.D.) should be mentioned here, as having
in turn epitomised Verrius, while Festus had the same kind
office performed for him by Paul the Deacon in the age of
Charlemagne.

Hyginus, the freedman and librarian of Augustus, and Ovid‘s
very intimate friend, was an antiquarian.
