of rice 3 at Rome, as in Greece, a similar shower
accompanied a transfer of property or of person (V.
624). The taper lighted in token of thanksgffing
was carried to a Roman shrine, and the votive picture
was hung on the wall of a Roman temple as such

offerings are still carried or hung by Christian ’

pilgrims (ΙΙΙ. 256-8). The praetor's rod (VI. 584),
which gave the slave his freedom, has a direct de-

scendant, though an ennobled one, in the sovereign's ἵ

swerd of knighthood.

ἓ 7.—CONNEXION OF LATIN WITH GREEK.

It will probably strike the young scholar as pre-
sumption that Englishmen should call in question
the derivations of Latin words given by a Roman
writer. He must, however, remember that Com-

. parative Philology‚ the science which treats of the

origin ancl growth and laws of language, is entirely
modern. It only came into existence when Sanskrit
began to be studied‚ after the English conquest of
]ndia in the early part of this century. It was then
found that Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, as well as
most of the other languages of Europe, sprang from
one common source, ancl by comparing them together
we can reconstruct many of the words of that simple
primeva] tongue, and trace out various ruleS‚ in
obedience to which its divergencies have been de-
veloped. · We must therefore be careful not to talk,
as Ovid does [eff. on Flora, IV. 197]‚ of Latin words
being derived from the Greek.
