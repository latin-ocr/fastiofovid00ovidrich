ΙΙΙ. Th‘e Ides were always eight days after the Nones.
eg. I.‘ on the lst of Jan„ Dee.‚' διο. = Kalendis saumariis,

Decembribus (adj ), &c. (Kal'. Jan. or Dec.).
II. ‘on the 5th of N ov ’=Nonis Novembribus (Non. Now).

III. ‘ on the 15th of March ’ = Idibus Martiis (Id. Mart.).

Other days—To express other days of the month they
counted back from the next succeeding Calcnds, Nones, or

Id'IJhe day before one of these was called Pridie Kalendas,

Nonas, or Idus.
To express ‘ two days before ' they said ‘ ante diem tertium

(not secundum) Kalendas, Nonas, or Idus.’
(N otice the confused grammar of the expression : we should

expect—lertio die ante Kalendas, but ante being placed at the
beginning, terlio die was changed to tertium diem, as if governed
by the proposition.)

Rule for nates—If you have a date to put into Latin, think
first if it is a Calends, Ides, or Nones.

If it is not, think which of these comes next.

e. g. 'Pake the 9th of September.

We say here—the Noncs are past: the Ides come next, z'.e.
on the 13th. 13 — 9 = 4, add 1 for the Roman way of counting,
zze. 5. Sept. 9th = ante diem quintum Idus Septembres (a. d.
V. Id. Sem).

Take 1111011161· example ε June 24th.

We want to know how many days there are before the

Calends of July. There are 30 days in June. 30 — 24 = 6,
z'.e. 7 before the ist of July. Add 1 more for the Roman
gssynpiflgsounting, τ’. e. 8. June 24th = a. d. VIII. Kal. J ulias or

In Leap Year a. d. VI. Kal. Mart. (24th Feb.) was counted
twice over, the 2nd being called dies bissextus. Leap Year =
Annus Bissextus.

‘ From ' and ‘ ἴθ’ a date—Such a date sometimes has a pre-

position put before it, as if it were one indeclinable word.
e. g. From June 24th to Sept. 9th = ex ante diem VIII. Kal.

Quint. in ante diem V. Id. Sept.

Hours of the Day.—-The Roman day of 24 hours was
divided‚ like our own, into two sets of 12 hours : the first of
these being counted from 6 A.M. (sunrise).

‘ To modern honr but add a six,
And that the Roman hour will fix.’
