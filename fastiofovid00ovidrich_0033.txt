Notae dierum. The days are divided into periods of 8 (Ι.
54), from one market-day(N11ndinae) to another, and are dis-

think it = Nefastus Purus (as the symbol of an ordinary dies
Ncfitslus,) as contrasted with N (= dies ater).

Year's gifts and cards. A Roman sehoolboy no less
than an English boy had his holidays ab Easter
(Quinquatrus III. 768). The bonfires of the Cels,
have a parallel in the ribes of the Palilia (IV. 655),
while Candlemas is a relic of Februatio, If we have
a May Queen and May Day, they too had Flora and
her Floralia (V. 181). We say ‘ there's luck in odd
numbers 'z so did the Romans. Our witches fly on
