Under cover of this story about Claudia Ovid defends the

ter Julia. Evil reports were mooted against her about 1 or 2 ¹j

B.c. when these lines were probably written.

242. nec facies impar... It might be possible to trans-
late ‘ nor was her beauty inferior to her rank (supplying genem)
in noblencss.' But in VI. 710 we have ‘par facies nobilitate'
which cau only mean ‘her beauty is not inferior to her noble
birth‚' par being equivalent to non minor and being followed
by the abl. A similar use of par is said to occur in Sallust,
but that passage is capable of another construction. On the
strength of VI. 710 however we must consider that impar in
this passage z minor.

the subject of a drama.
