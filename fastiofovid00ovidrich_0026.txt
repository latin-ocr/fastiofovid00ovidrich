xvi OVJDJJ FASTJ. [5 2 4

The com- rough copy. Phe latter part, even 0f
plete poem Book VI, is little more than this, show-

ing many signs of haste and incomplete ³

and of which he probably wrote at least his i

ness. It ends with June, but there are severs
r·efe1ences to later parts of the poem which have 1
not come down to us, e..9 111.49 [57]‘ cum Laren ’
talia dicam' ·the Larentalia was in December. ΙΙΓ.
192 [200]‘ Consus tibi cetera dicet.. . . cum Sia
sacra canes.' the festival of Consus was in August.

V. 147, ‘ Quo feror? Augustus mensis mihi carminis
huius Ius habet.'

Furthermore, Ovid himself says (Tristia II. 549)—

4

Sex ego fastorum scripsi totidemque libellos, Ι
Cumque suo finem mense libellus habet ε 1
quue tuo nuper scriptum sub nomine, Caesar,
Et tibi sacratum sors mea mpit opus.

Gronovius, quoted by Merkel in his critical notetss
p. 303, repeats the statement made in an ancient
edition, that the last six books were in existence;
‘servantur apud presbyterum in pago prope Ulmam ’τ
and a first couplet is quoted, which differs however
from another version of the couplet preserved in twcj- ἕ
or three of the MSS.

Leaving the doubtful question of the last six books,

and confining our attention to the εἰΧ
ῡξξξξὸὲίε 0¹² which are now extant, we find indica·
vision tions of a first copy, and of a Subsequent»
revision.

The book was dedicated in the first instance toſjf
Augustus, and Merkel thinks the first lines were}
written about l or 2 13.c. WVhen Ovid was banished, ’-
A. n 9, the work seems to have been laid on the shelf
and to have remained there until Augustus’ s death, t

in A. D. 14. Then it was revis <ed as far as the end οΓ
