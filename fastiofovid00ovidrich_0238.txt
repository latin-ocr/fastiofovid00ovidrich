309. metabimur ‘will map out' as a soldier would a
camp. The military metaphor, suggested by the mention of
the warring Giants in the last line, is kept up in this word, and
in clu-sibus and szgrna.

310. suos ‘the days appropriate to them ' i.e. to the vaga
agna ‘the shifting constellations,’

Itis hardly necessary to state here that the reflexive pro-
nouns se and suus, in their ordinary construction, refer to the
subject of the verb, usually of the principal verb. Sometimes
however the reflexive refers to a case other than the nom. or
acc. of the subject, notably and most frequently in close com-
bination with various cases of quisque, as in ‘ suum cuique est0‚’
where suum refers to the dative, cuique. So it sometimes has
reference t0 other words which are not the grammatical subjects
of a sentence, provided always that no ambiguity is possible.
Perhaps we may say that in such cases the reflexive refers to
the logical subject, or an implied subject, rather than to the
grammatical subject of the sentence.

Ovid appears specially fond of this use of suus, which lends
itself to the brachylogical turn of expression appropriate to the
Elegiae couplet. In an Appendix (ζ) Ι have put together the
instances which occur in the Fasti.
