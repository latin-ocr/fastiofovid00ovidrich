We have seen that Ovid possessed a great natura
taste and aptitude for poetry ; he wrote with perfect
ease and fluency, and was a master of the
technicalities of his art, though he shrank poetic„
from the “limae labor;’' indeed Seneca P0W2r⁵
says of him, “that he lacked not critical
acumen, but the inclination to prime 3 he sometimes
used to say that a mole or two made a comely face
more comely.’' In disposition he was joyous and
light-hearted, incapable of seriousness or self-disci-
pline. Even in his graver work, such as the Fasti,
he plays lightly with his task, and finds food for
merriment in the exploits of gods and goddesses.
We may suppose that his choice of the elegiac as his
favourite metro was determined by its fitness for neat
and witty turns, without the necessity for sustained
effort, and by his fondness for rhetorical expression,
which must have been fostered by his early training.
The poetica] rhetoric of his schoolboy-days finds its
counterpart in the somewhat rhetorical poetry of his
later years. Both Seneca and Quintilian show their
Ἰ high appreciation of him by the frequency with
¹ which they quote his works, and the latter ¹3 says that
the Medea shows what he could have done if he had
chosen to exercise sels-restraint in using his poetic
ability. Tacitus bears testimony to the same effect,

but thet poem, except a few lines quoted by Quintilian,
is os o us.
