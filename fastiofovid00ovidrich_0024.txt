pleasure, with his cultivated tastes and luxurious
habits, is driven from wife and home, and from the
literary friends whose society and approbation were
the very breath of his nostrils, to the cold and distant
Euxine, and the companionship of outer barbarians.
He felt the change as Dr. Johnson might have
felt a sentence of perpetual banishment from Fleet
Street to the farthest Hebrides. Little wonder if
the poet, here as elsewhere incapable of self-control,

pours out his heart in ceaseless wailings ‘2

His la· and petitions, grovelling in the very dust
ments before Augustus and Tiberius and their
imperial house, in the vain hope of par—

don. It was with this motive that he dedicated to
Tiberius’s heir Germanicus the revised edition of his
Fasti-‚¹¹ Yet even in exile his amiable disposition
won him friends among his rough neighbours, and

the poet’s thoughts still found their utterance in
verse, so that he even wrote a poem in the Getic

language.12
Death He died at Tomi A.D. 18.
Poems His poems may be placed in three

classes: (1) those of early life 3 (2) those ς

of middle age, written before his banishment 3 and
(3) those written at Tomi.

(l) Love poems (written partly in imitation of the ι-

Alexandrine poets, and of his predecessors at Rome,
Gallus, Tibullus, Propertius), the Heroides, and a
tragedy‚ the Medea.

(²2) The Fasti (suggested perhaps by the last book
of Propertius), and the Metamorphoses.

(3) Five books of Tristia, and four of Epistles
from Pomm, Ibis (a lampeon), Halieutiea (on the fish
of the Black Sea).
