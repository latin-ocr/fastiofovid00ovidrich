Book L, and re-dedicated to Tiberius's adopted son
and heir, the learned ycang Germanicus, himself

a poet, through whose favour Ovid vainly hope&
:o gain his recall.

*Book 1.—Then were added

Ι. 1-26 (except verses 1, 2, 7, 8, 13, 14), the new dedication
Germanicus, addressed by name in l. 3.

Ι. 63, which probably alludcs to Gcrmanicus’s consulship.

Ι. 223-6, in whizh a temple os Janus, restored by Tiberius,
ι alluded to (cf. Tac. Anu. ll. 49),

1. 281—8, where Tiberius and Germanicus are spoken os as

·011 ads] thoe {ziumph decreed to Germanicus, A. D. 15, sor victories
ver e a ι.

’ f 1. 481—484 [531-5341. Here Tiberius is mentioued as Em·
ποτ, and is called ‘ nepos natusque dei!

Ι. 486 [536]. The title of ‘Augusta Iulia ’ was not given tt
via until aster Augustus’s death, by his will.

1. 540 [590]. ‘Et tuus Augusto nomine dictus avus' is again
dressed to Germanicus.

Ι. 579—590 [639-650} Ovid here speaks of the Temple of
'oncord restored A.D. 10 by Tiberius and Livia: and of the
›nquest of the Sigambri by Tiberius about the same time.

I. 389, 431—434 [481—484], 490 [540] were added at the
ame time, as they contain allusions to'the poet's exile.

Book 11.-V1.·—From the beginning of Book ΙΙ. to the
end of VI. with the exception of one or possibly two passages,
uo event is spoken of which occurred later than Ovid’s banish-
nent in ΔΑ). 9. The lines IV. 81—84 refer to the exile an'd
rere of course inserted afterwards, and it is possible that VI.
,⁴74 was similarly inspired, though Merkel does not think sc.
Otherwise the whole of this part of the poem is left as the poet
originally wrote it before his exile, and the unfim'shed state of
'she end of Book VI. is shown by various instances of repetition
md loose grammar.
