252 NOTES. BOOK III. [ll. 614-6362

614. dissimulo ‘ to hide what you feel ' ε simulo ‘ to
pretend what you dou't feeL' ⁶ Quod non est simulo, dissimulo-1
que quod est.

617. exactum ‘ thought out-3

618. cupit ulta mori. The stress is 011 the participle:
‘She longs to avenge herself before she dies) We use the<
same sort of expression: ‘See Naples and die) And cf.
Thueydules l. 20, τύραννος ὢν ἀπέθανε, ‘Hipparchus at the
time of his death was in power’ : here again the stress is 011
the participle and not 011 the verb.

622. sub verbum ‘immediately upon the word.’ [ fen-es-
ἵνα 001111. with φαίν-ω.]

625. recincta ‘unfastened‚' ‘ ungirdled’ in her haste.

627. Numicius a river of Latium. corniger is a com-
mon epithet of river gods, a river being like a bull from the
roaring of its watem, and from its strength and force. Horace,
Od. IV„ xiv. 25 ‘sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus.' And
Sophocles in the Trachiniae represents the Achelous as horned.

629. Sidonis the Sidonian woman, ἱ. e. Anna.

634. perenne. Adjectives in -is, -e form, very rarely,
an ablative in ὅ. nobil? viro occurs in Cicero ε caeleste, bz'meslrff,
and perennc? 111 Ovid. With ἔ nouus this form of the abl. is
more frequent: mare‘, ⁷¹ete“‚ Praeneste} &a

635. erratis agris. To the rulc that lntransitive verbs
take no object after them, and that in the passive voice they ⁴
are gnly used impersonally, certain exceptions are to bc
note .

(1) They may take a cognate accus, as ‘lude1·e...ludum.'

(2) They sometimes, and chiefly in poetry, ‘sake what Dr.
Kennedy (cf. Pub. Sclzool Lat. Grammar ξ 122> has called a
“ Contained Accusative, expressing some 1111111οᾶ operation of
the verb.'’ That such an accusative is possible after the verb
in its active voice, is implied by the frequent persona] con-
struction of such intransitive verbs in the passive voice,
especially in the past participle passive. Mr. l‘aley remarks
that this usage is chiefly found in verbs of the ist conj.

Examples of this construction occurring in the Fczslz' will bc
found in Appendix η, at the end of the book.

636. celebrant seque diemque an instance of zeugma:
‘ they make themselves merry and keep the holiday.' cele.
brant (from celeber) implies that they do it ‘ in throngs.'
